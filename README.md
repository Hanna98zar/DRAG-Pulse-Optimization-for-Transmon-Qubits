# DRAG-Pulse-Optimization-for-Transmon-Qubits

## Description:
This repository explores the optimization of Gaussian and DRAG pulses for transmon qubits. Leveraging simulations and numerical methods, the project evaluates how different pulse parameters influence state probabilities, leakage errors, and gate fidelity.

## Key Features
1. Pulse Design: Implements Gaussian and DRAG pulse shapes using closed-form solutions for amplitude parameters.
2. Simulation: Solves the transmon Hamiltonian in the presence of drive and DRAG terms, analyzing qubit dynamics over time.
3. Optimization: Tunes pulse parameters such as the DRAG coefficient Î» to achieve maximum fidelity and minimize leakage.
4. Visualization: Includes time evolution plots of state probabilities and pulse shapes.

## Future Directions
1. Explore multi-qubit systems
2. Incorporate decoherence and noise models
3. Extend optimization to include other pulse shapes
