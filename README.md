# DRAG-Pulse-Optimization-for-Transmon-Qubits
 This project optimizes Gaussian and DRAG pulses for transmon qubits to minimize leakage and maximize gate fidelity. Simulations of the transmon Hamiltonian reveal insights into quantum gate performance through parameter tuning and state probability visualization.
